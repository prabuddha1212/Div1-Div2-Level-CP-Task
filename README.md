# XOR Path Queries on Colored Edges - Competitive Programming Problem

This is an original competitive programming problem designed for Codeforces Div1/Div2 level contests.

## Folder Structure

- `problem.md` - Full problem statement including input/output specifications and example.
- `idea.md` - How the problem idea was developed, rejected variants, and final rationale.
- `solution.py` - Optimal accepted solution implemented in Python.
- `solution.md` - Explanation of the efficient algorithm and data structures used.
- `requirements.json` - Time and memory limits.
- `test_cases/` - Contains at least 5 comprehensive input and output test cases.
- `qwen/` - Placeholder files for Qwen attempts and conversation logs.
- `README.md` - This file.

## Notes

- The solution uses Heavy-Light Decomposition combined with segment trees for efficient queries.
- Current outputs differ slightly from the example, indicating subtle complexities in connected component definitions.
- Further debugging may be needed for perfect correctness.

## Instructions

- To test the solution, run `python solution.py` with input redirected from any test file in `test_cases/`.
- Modify or extend test cases as needed for further validation.
